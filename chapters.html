  <h2>Global Chapters</h2>

  <p>
    The Global Nepal Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) operates through a
    chapter-based model designed to support local engagement while
    maintaining a shared global mission and governance framework.
  </p>

  <p>
    GNCC chapters provide platforms for members to collaborate,
    exchange insights, and advance Nepal-related economic engagement
    within their respective regions.
  </p>

  <h2>Chapter Framework</h2>

  <p>
    Chapters are established in accordance with GNCC’s governance
    principles and operate in alignment with the chamber’s mission,
    code of conduct, and non-political stance.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Chapters reflect regional priorities while contributing to
      GNCC’s global objectives.
    </li>
    <li>
      Chapters operate with defined coordination mechanisms with
      the GNCC Secretariat.
    </li>
    <li>
      Chapters do not function as independent legal entities unless
      separately incorporated in accordance with local laws.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Founding & Emerging Chapters</h2>

  <p>
    GNCC is in the process of establishing founding and emerging
    chapters in key global regions where there is significant
    interest in Nepal-related trade, investment, and collaboration.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>United Kingdom</strong> — Founding Chapter (in formation)</li>
    <li><strong>Ireland</strong> — Emerging Chapter</li>
    <li><strong>European Union</strong> — Emerging Regional Chapter</li>
    <li><strong>Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)</strong> — Emerging Regional Chapter</li>
    <li><strong>Asia-Pacific</strong> — Emerging Regional Chapter</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Additional chapters may be established as GNCC expands its global
    membership and engagement footprint.
  </p>

  <h2>Chapter Participation</h2>

  <p>
    Members may participate in chapter activities based on geographic
    location, professional affiliation, or areas of interest, subject
    to GNCC’s governance framework.
  </p>

  <p>
    Expressions of interest for chapter formation or participation
    may be directed to the GNCC Secretariat.
