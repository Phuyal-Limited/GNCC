      <p class="text-measure fw-semibold">
        The Executive Committee exercises its responsibilities through
        defined decision-making processes, delegated authorities, and
        periodic review mechanisms, ensuring accountability and continuity
        during the chamber’s founding phase.
      </p>
      <p class="text-measure">
        During the interim phase, Executive Committee members may be
        appointed to establish foundational systems and processes.
        Future composition and selection mechanisms may include elections
        or member nominations, as determined by GNCC’s evolving governance
        framework.
