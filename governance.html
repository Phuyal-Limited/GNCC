  <h2>Governance</h2>

  <p>
    The Global Nepal Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) is committed to principles
    of good governance, transparency, and institutional integrity.
    GNCC operates as an independent, non-political, and member-driven
    chamber platform.
  </p>

  <p>
    The governance framework outlined below represents an interim and
    foundational structure, intended to support the responsible growth
    of GNCC and to evolve in line with international best practices and
    member participation.
  </p>

  <h2>Governance Structure</h2>

  <p>
    GNCC’s governance framework is designed to balance strategic
    direction, operational oversight, and broad-based representation.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>General Membership:</strong>
      The collective body of members, forming the foundation of GNCC’s
      representative mandate.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Executive Committee:</strong>
      Responsible for strategic oversight, policy direction, and
      stewardship of the chamber’s objectives.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Advisory Council:</strong>
      A consultative body providing independent guidance, expertise,
      and international perspective.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Secretariat:</strong>
      Responsible for day-to-day administration, coordination, and
      implementation of approved programmes and activities.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Executive Committee</h2>

  <p>
    The Executive Committee provides leadership and oversight to GNCC
    and acts in the best interests of the membership and the chamber’s
    mission.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the interim phase, Executive Committee members may be
    appointed to establish foundational systems and processes.
    Future composition and selection mechanisms may include elections
    or member nominations, as determined by GNCC’s evolving governance
    framework.
  </p>

  <h2>Advisory Council</h2>

  <p>
    The Advisory Council supports GNCC by offering non-binding advice,
    strategic insight, and subject-matter expertise drawn from business,
    academia, and international institutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Advisory Council members do not hold executive authority and serve
    in an advisory capacity only.
  </p>

  <h2>Principles of Governance</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Independence:</strong> GNCC operates independently of political parties and partisan interests.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Decision-making processes are conducted in a clear and accountable manner.</li>
    <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> GNCC encourages participation across sectors, geographies, and communities.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Ethical conduct and responsible leadership are central to GNCC’s operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Leadership and structures are accountable to the membership.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Evolution of Governance</h2>

  <p>
    GNCC recognises that governance frameworks must evolve as the
    organisation grows. This governance structure may be reviewed and
    refined periodically to reflect organisational maturity, geographic
    expansion, and member feedback.
