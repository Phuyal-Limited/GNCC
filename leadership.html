  <h2>Leadership</h2>

  <p>
    The leadership of the Global Nepal Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) is
    responsible for providing strategic direction, institutional
    stewardship, and oversight in alignment with GNCC’s mission and
    governance principles.
  </p>

  <p>
    GNCC is currently operating under an interim and founding leadership
    framework, established to support the formation, early development,
    and responsible growth of the chamber.
  </p>

  <h2>Founding & Interim Leadership</h2>

  <p>
    During the founding phase, interim leadership roles are appointed to
    ensure continuity, operational readiness, and adherence to GNCC’s
    guiding principles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Details of interim office bearers and leadership roles will be
    published in due course, in line with GNCC’s governance framework
    and transparency commitments.
  </p>

  <h2>Roles & Responsibilities</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Strategic Oversight:</strong>
      Guiding the long-term vision, priorities, and institutional
      direction of GNCC.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Representation:</strong>
      Acting as custodians of GNCC’s values in external engagements
      with members, partners, and stakeholders.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Governance & Integrity:</strong>
      Upholding GNCC’s governance framework, ethical standards,
      and non-political stance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Institution Building:</strong>
      Supporting the establishment of chapters, programmes,
      and sustainable operational structures.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Advisory Participation</h2>

  <p>
    GNCC may invite distinguished individuals from business, academia,
    and international institutions to contribute in an advisory
    capacity. Advisory participants provide guidance and insight
    without executive authority.
  </p>

  <h2>Future Leadership Evolution</h2>

  <p>
    As GNCC matures, leadership structures and selection mechanisms
    may evolve to include broader member participation, nominations,
    or elections, consistent with international chamber practices.
